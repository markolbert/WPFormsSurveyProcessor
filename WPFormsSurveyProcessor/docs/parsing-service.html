<p>Exporting to Excel is handled by a C# <a href="https://github.com/nissl-lab/npoi">NPOI library</a>. That library creates the Excel workbook and worksheets in memory and then allows you to write the result to an .xlsx file.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-the-files">Parsing the Files</h2>
<p>This service parses two files:</p>
<ul>
<li>a JSON-formatted file of WordPress posts, whose path was specified on the command line with the <strong>/p</strong> or <strong>/posts</strong> option; and,</li>
<li>a JSON-formatted file of WPForms responses, whose path was specified on the command line with the <strong>/e</strong> or <strong>/entries</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
<p>All posts other than those defined by WPForms are ignored. All WPForms form definitions, whether or not they are for surveys, are included.</p>
<p>The files are assumed to have been exported by PHPMyAdmin, which creates download files structured in a particular way.</p>
<p>The service first parses the WordPress posts file to determine the WPForms form definitions. It does that by calling the <code>ParseFile()</code> method on an instance of <code>WpFormsParser</code>, supplying the path defined on the command line with the <strong>/p</strong> or <strong>/posts</strong> option.</p>
<p>Next, the service parses the WPForms entries file to determine the user survey responses. It does that by calling the <code>ParseFile()</code> method on an instance of <code>WpResponsesParser</code>, supplying the path defined on the command line with the <strong>/e</strong> or <strong>/entries</strong> option.</p>
<p>For more information on <code>WpFormsParser</code> and <code>WpResponsesParser</code>, consult their <a href="https://github.com/markolbert/WPFormsSurveyProcessor/blob/master/WpFormsSurvey/docs/readme.md">github repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-to-excel">Exporting to Excel</h2>
<p>Once the form definitions and survey responses have been parsed, one or more exporters are called to create specific spreadsheets in an Excel .xlsx file. The exporters all derive from <code>ExportBase</code>, a generic base class defining a number of methods to create and format tabular data and named ranges in an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Each derived exporter class overrides the <code>GetRecords()</code> abstract method to create an instance of the data needed for each row of the data table being created. Rows are created based on those instances in the overriden <code>ProcessRecord()</code> method.</p>
<p>The entire export/table creation process is wrapped by two other methods, <code>StartExport()</code> and <code>FinishExport()</code>.</p>
<p>The overridden <code>StartExport()</code> methods typically create the header row for each table, although they can do other initialization work as well.</p>
<p>The overridden <code>FinishExport()</code> methods typically autosize one or more table columns and create whatever named ranges were defined for their spreadsheet in the <code>appConfig.json</code> file.</p>
